People who believe in fate often have a greater sense of perspective and recognition that everything happens for a reason. This can help people cope with difficult problems that may arise in life, since believing in fate can give them a sense of peace and hope that they are in their current path for a reason. However, on the other hand, relying too much on faith and having too much confidence in fate can lead to passivity, as people can become too complacent and expect things to happen without any effort or action from themselves. This can be a hindrance in achieving goals, as it allows for a lack of responsibility and agency and leaves one in a vulnerable position.At the core of it, although a belief in fate offers comfort and assurance, too much reliance on it can be a hindrance in life. To strike a balance, one should not rely too much on fate, but still be guided by it and make sure to take responsibility for one\u2019s actions. Only then can one make the most of their circumstances and make the best of their life."
